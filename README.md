# Poker Player Need to Know
- I am a avid poker fan and a recreational poker player. For our assignment I thought using a poker player as an object and assigning stats and personal info as properties to that object would be a good application of the assignment instructions.
- Poker players have stats and info that fit nicely into the object syntax. They also work well for creating a constructor function. Ideally, I would have preferred to build a function that works dynamically with each object (pokerplayer) and I think after I turn this project in, I will work on doing exactly that.

# Object
This is an example of what how the app can take the properties of each object and print them into a player bio.
